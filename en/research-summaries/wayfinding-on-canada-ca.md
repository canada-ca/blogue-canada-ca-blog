<p>Date: Dec X, 2022</p>
<p>Government departments and agencies are adopting the Canada.ca design to enhance trust and ease of use through a consistent experience. The design includes core brand elements and navigation patterns. Users need to be able to quickly recognize official government information and services to avoid fraudulent sites. They also need intuitive patterns to navigate and get their tasks done.</p>
<p>One of the core brand elements is the global header, which includes a theme and topic menu. This menu has several pain points. The Digital Transformation Office (DTO) conducted a set of studies to understand  the role and impact of the menu on in-site navigation.</p>

<h2>Understanding the problem</h2>
<p>Wayfinding is how users assess where they are in a website and plan a route to follow. On Canada.ca, the menu is a way for users to navigate through the site. It displays top-level pages (themes) to help users find answers and services.</p>
<p>While many visits start from a search engine result, the website should support navigation no matter where a user enters the site. This is especially important when they start their journey on the wrong page.</p>
<p>Some departments have expressed concerns about adopting the Canada.ca design as the menu would compete with their existing local menus or not provide any navigational benefit.  For example, Statistics Canada has a statistics menu for the same themes that are present in the Canada.ca menu. Veterans Affairs Canada provides benefits that are similar but different from the benefits in the current menu.</p>
<p>We worked with these and other departments to explore navigation and design options to facilitate the adoption of the Canada.ca design.</p>
<p>The goals of this extensive research study were:</p>
<ul>
<li>explore options to replace the menu</li>
<li>do no harm to existing task success on sites that have already transitioned to the Canada.ca design</li>
<li>improve navigation to top tasks from different themes/departments</li> 
</ul>
<p>We conducted 2 large rounds of task performance usability testing and used web analytics to inform our design sprints. Just as in the studies, the analytics showed that breadcrumbs are used more than the menu:</p>
<ul>
<li>4.7% of visits use the breadcrumbs</li>  
<li>2.6% of visits use the menu</li> 
</ul>
<p>This suggested that it would be possible to replace the menu without affecting task success. We also noticed that people often used the menu to sign into accounts. This suggested that creating a different sign-in route could further reduce the use of the menu.</p>
<h2>Establishing a baseline</h2>
<p>The initial study in 2019 established a baseline measurement of the top tasks for each participating department. The research compared sites with the Canada.ca design against sites from departments with different designs. At that time, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship (IRC) had adopted the Canada.ca design, whereas Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada (AAFC), Veterans Affairs Canada (VAC) and Statistics Canada (StatCan) had not.</p>
<p>20 participants tested 12 tasks from those departments to understand pain points with the menu and give us ideas for potential solutions. The participants included:</p> 
<ul>
<li>international students</li>  
<li>farmers</li>  
<li>veterans</li>  
<li>academics</li>  
<p>The study involved typical tasks users complete on each departmental site, including a scenario that started on a Google search results page.</p>
