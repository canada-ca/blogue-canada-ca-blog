description: "The wayfinding study investigated issues with Canada.ca navigation and informed changes to improve navigation and simplify the adoption of the Canada.ca design for departments and agencies.  The main improvements include the introduction of a new sign in button, removing the menu button, a contextual footer band, a main footer band with themes, and a simplified design for the theme page."

<p class="mrgn-tp-lg">To better understand how people navigate different parts of the Government of Canada web presence, the Digital Transformation Office carried out a wayfinding research project.  We were particularly interested in how people used the global theme and topic menu on Canada.ca.  We knew that some institutions were finding that the menu wasn’t meeting their more complex navigation needs.   In some cases, this meant that institutions weren’t adopting the Canada.ca design.</p>

<p>We needed to look beyond the menu though and toward navigation habits as a whole to see how institutions could meet user needs effectively.</p>

<blockquote class="mrgn-tp-lg">
  <p>Navigation is about wayfinding, you can't treat it as separate because many other things run parallel with it. If you look at studies in wayfinding, everything from exhibit design to building the cathedrals, it's about creating a complete system. It's about looking at the whole.</p>

<h2>The Wayfinding project</h2>
<p>The research included a baseline study to discover and assess findability problems and a comparison study to test possible solutions. Our findings have directed changes to the Canada.ca design.</p>
<p>Research and prototyping explored options to remove the menu while maintaining or improving the effectiveness of global navigation.  We also wanted to preserve the confidence and trust we’ve established with the Canada.ca site brand.</p>
<p>Our prototype included the following design elements for testing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>a global header without a menu</li>
   <li>theme links from the menu moved to the footer</li>
   <li>a Sign in button in the global header</li>
   <li>more prominent breadcrumb links</li>
   <li>a simplified theme page template</li>
</ul>
<p>We applied the new design to pages that were already using the Canada.ca design, as well as pages that weren't. Task success remained consistent and there was even an improvement for navigating between themes.  One of the reasons for the consistent performance is that breadcrumbs are used more often than the global menu for navigation.  People can find their destination when there are clear links to theme-level pages in the breadcrumb.  We also found that people use the menu to find a way to sign into their account.  Signing in is a top task on Canada.ca!  An exposed contextual Sign in button on relevant pages will significantly reduce the use of the menu.  The Sign in button is placed at the top-right, just below the global header, an area where people typically look for signing into an account.</p>

<h2 class="mrgn-tp-lg">A transitional approach to change</h2>
<p>We are using a transitional approach to make these design improvements to our navigation.  Some of the work has already been done. This is our roll-out plan.</p>
<h3>1. Updates to the Canada.ca homepage</h3>
<p><span class="fas fa-check text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span> Done</p>
<p>Analysis of footer usage patterns on the home page vs all other pages showed that some footer links were used a lot from the Canada.ca homepage, but very little from elsewhere in the site. We’ve moved these links out of the footer and into the content section of the Canada.ca homepage. This makes them more visible where people actually use them, and frees up space in the footer for more appropriate links.</p>

<div class="clearfix"></div>
<h3 class="mrgn-tp-lg">2. Contextual Sign in button</h3>
<p><span class="fas fa-check text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span> Available to use</p>
<p>The global header now includes the contextual Sign in button.  It is an optional element to be used on pages where people are likely looking to sign in to an account.  We saw that a lot of people used the global menu to access a sign in page.  When signing in is a top task, presenting a Sign in button in the top right of the content area makes signing in more obvious and easy.</p> 
<p>Some pages may have both the global menu and the new Sign in button during the transition period.  As dependency on the menu decreases over time, you can remove the menu without disrupting access to the sign in tasks.</p>

<h3 class="mrgn-tp-lg">3. Footer updates</h3>
<p><span class="fas fa-check text-success mrgn-rght-sm"></span> Available to use</p>
<p>To further reduce dependency on the theme and topic menu, we’ve made some adjustments to the Global footer. The new Global footer is made up of three content bands.</p>  
<h4>Contextual-footer band</h4>
<p>The contextual band is optional and configurable.  Institutions can provide up to three contextual support links that are relevant to the content within a  group of pages. For example, departments who had a contextualized contact link in the old footer can now configure this contextual band to include a direct contact link.</p>   
<p>Bear in mind that footer links are mostly used as rescue links. They are often a last resort for frustrated people who can’t find what they’re looking for.</p>  
<h4>Main-footer band</h4>
<p>We’ve added the links to all theme and audience pages into the main footer band. This band is mandatory on standard pages to provide a consistent base to the majority of the web presence. It’s optional on transactional and campaign pages where people are focussed on a very specific task and you want to reduce distractions as much as possible.  You can’t configure this band.</p>  
<h4>Sub-footer band</h4>
<p>The sub-footer band is mandatory on all pages.  It contains the Canada wordmark and corporate links to “Social media,” “Mobile applications,” “About Canada.ca,” “Terms and conditions,” and “Privacy”. Institutions can contextualize both the Terms and conditions link and the Privacy link. The other links are optional on transactional and campaign pages where you want to reduce distractions as much as possible.</p>

<h3 class="mrgn-tp-lg">4. Retire the global menu button</h3>
<p><span class="fas fa-circle text-warning mrgn-rght-sm"></span> Available in the near future.</p>
<p>Our research shows that the theme and topic menu isn’t essential to successful navigation. We can move things out of the menu without disrupting people’s task success, and in some cases we can make it easier to find key tasks, like Sign in.  As departments implement other changes, like the updated footer and contextual Sign in buttons where needed, we expect they'll see a decline in menu use. When web analytics show that people are using the menu less than 1% of the time within a certain set of pages, departments can remove it. This is a staged approach aimed at gently encouraging users to shift their navigating habits.</p>
<h3 class="mrgn-tp-lg">5. Simplified theme page design</h3>
<p><span class="fas fa-circle text-warning mrgn-rght-sm"></span> Available in the future.</p>
<p>We still need theme pages to play an organizing function in our information architecture, but we can simplify the layout. We’re working toward updating the theme page template to provide more straightforward access to top tasks.  Our research will consider a navigation bar to help people navigate across themes and a Most requested band.   We’re removing the features section and social media links because analytics show that people rarely use them.</p>
<h2>Final thoughts</h2>
<p>Stay tuned!  This is a transition process that will take some time to complete.</p>
<p>We are continuing to conduct research and analysis to improve navigation and brand trust.   There are always areas that can be improved and new challenges will arise as we transition to these new patterns.  Share your experience with us.  Ask us how you can participate in research.</p>
